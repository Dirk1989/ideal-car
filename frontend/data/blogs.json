    "title": "Why Older, High-Mileage Cars Should Be Serviced Every 10 000 km and Tyres Replaced on Time",
    "excerpt": "Keeping your older car in top condition isn't just about looks — it's about safety, reliability, and saving money in the long run. For high-mileage vehicles, servicing every 10 000 km instead of 15 000 km and replacing tyres when they expire can prevent breakdowns, improve performance, and ensure you stay safe on South African roads.",
    "content": "<h2>The Importance of Regular Servicing for High-Mileage Vehicles</h2><p>If you're driving an older car with high mileage, regular maintenance becomes even more critical. While newer vehicles can often handle 15 000 km service intervals, older cars benefit greatly from more frequent attention.</p><h3>Why Every 10 000 km?</h3><p>As vehicles age and accumulate kilometers, their components experience more wear and tear. Oil breaks down faster, filters clog more quickly, and small issues can escalate into major problems if left unchecked. Servicing every 10 000 km allows mechanics to:</p><ul><li>Catch potential issues before they become expensive repairs</li><li>Replace worn fluids that lose effectiveness faster in older engines</li><li>Check critical safety components like brakes and suspension</li><li>Maintain optimal fuel efficiency</li><li>Extend the lifespan of your vehicle</li></ul><h2>Tyre Safety: Don't Ignore Expiry Dates</h2><p>Many drivers don't realize that tyres have expiry dates, typically around 6 years from manufacture regardless of tread depth. In South Africa's varying climate conditions, this becomes even more important.</p><h3>Why Replace Expired Tyres?</h3><p>Over time, rubber compounds deteriorate due to:</p><ul><li>UV exposure from the South African sun</li><li>Temperature fluctuations</li><li>Ozone and environmental factors</li><li>Natural aging of the rubber compounds</li></ul><p>Expired tyres can lead to:</p><ul><li>Reduced grip, especially in wet conditions</li><li>Increased risk of blowouts</li><li>Longer braking distances</li><li>Poor handling and stability</li></ul><h3>How to Check Your Tyre Age</h3><p>Look for the DOT code on your tyre sidewall. The last four digits indicate the week and year of manufacture. For example, \"2618\" means the 26th week of 2018.</p><h2>The Cost-Benefit Analysis</h2><p>While more frequent servicing and timely tyre replacement might seem expensive, consider the alternatives:</p><ul><li>A major engine repair can cost R20 000 - R50 000+</li><li>A tyre blowout at highway speed could result in a serious accident</li><li>Poor maintenance reduces resale value significantly</li><li>Roadside breakdowns cost time, money, and stress</li></ul><p>Regular R2 000 - R3 000 services are far more affordable than a single major repair.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>For older, high-mileage vehicles, preventative maintenance is your best investment. Service every 10 000 km, check your tyre dates regularly, and address issues promptly. Your wallet, your safety, and your peace of mind will thank you.</p><p>At IdealCar, we recommend keeping detailed service records and working with trusted mechanics who understand the specific needs of high-mileage vehicles. Stay safe on South African roads!</p>",
